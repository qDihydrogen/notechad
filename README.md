notechad is a ~~very good~~ free primitive text editor written in Python 3(.9) and Pygame.

## installation
there are two ways to run notechad.
### .exe file
running the .exe file should be all that is necessary. **THE EXECUTABLE MIGHT ONLY WORK ON WINDOWS 10.** the latest version of notechad can be found [here](https://github.com/qDihydrogen/notechad/releases)
### .py file
to run the python file, you should have the [most recent version of Python 3](https://python.org/downloads). older versions of Python 3 can work should they be at earliest Python 3.6. else, it will not work.


using pip in the terminal, you may now enter one of the following to install Pygame (module for a graphical interface):

`pip install pygame`

`pip3 install pygame`

`python -m pip install pygame`

`python3 -m pip install pygame`

you may now run the .py file through the terminal or by double-clicking in the file explorer.

## controls
| KEY | FUNCTION |
|--|--|
| UP | Navigates through lines of text and navigates through settings. If navigating through lines out of range, new lines will be created in place. |
| DOWN | Same as up. |
| LEFT | Used to change settings. |
| RIGHT | Same as left. |
| ENTER | Changes a line. |
| LEFT SHIFT | Toggles between document and settings. |
| SPACE | Creates new lines below the selected line. |
| BACKSPACE | Deletes the selected line. |
| ESCAPE | Toggles dark mode. Light mode is on by default. |
| LEFT CTRL | Saves your lines and ADDS them to a file output.txt (note that this will NOT overwrite what is already there) |
| RIGHT CTRL | Loads from output.txt after given permission. |
| TAB | Jump to a line. If out of range, will be put on the first or last line depending on input. |

## to do

 - general design improvement
 - more customization abilities such as changing colors
 - markdown support
 - put an actual icon
 - comment the code
 - allow commenting lines that do not show up on output.txt

## permissions
kinda do whatever? just don't claim that notechad is yours (but why would you claim this to be yours) and i'll most likely be fine.
some things that you may do if you want include
 - translations
 - forks and other modifications
 - pull requests if you really want (though i might not accept them!)
 - make binaries for other OS's such as Mac OS X and Linux
